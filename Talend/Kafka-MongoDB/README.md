# [Talend: Kafka and MongoDB - real-time streaming](https://bigdata-etl.com/?p=2257)

In today’s world, we often meet requirements for real-time data processing. There are quite a few tools on the market that allow us to achieve this. At the forefront we can distinguish: Apache Kafka and Apache Flink. Often in the same “bag” you can still meet Spark Structured Streaming or Spark Streaming, but this is a mistake, because Spark represents an approach that we call “micro-batch” – that is, processing data in small packages.

In this post, our goal will be to create real-time streaming processing using architecture created using docker-compose. We implement the processing logic in Talend Open Studio for Big Data (TOSBD).
